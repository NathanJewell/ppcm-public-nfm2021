two parts: where is the tag right now?, where will the tag be next?

--- where is it now?
get item locations from apriltags
get matching depth from raw image data
calculate metadata from depth
use depth to find location in camera coords (x, y, z=0?)
convert camera coords to world coords
store item location with historical data

--- where will it be?
do linear regression on last [n] positions
or do non-linear regression on last [n] positions (curvature calculations?)
publish equations?
publish estimate after t?
